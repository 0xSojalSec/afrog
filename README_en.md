# What is afrog

afrog is an excellent performance, fast and stable, PoC customizable vulnerability scanning (hole digging) tool. PoC involves CVE, CNVD, default password, information leakage, fingerprint identification, unauthorized access, arbitrary file reading, command execution, etc. It helps network security practitioners quickly verify and fix vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

# Features

* [x] Based on xray kernel, not like xray ([afrog template syntax](https://github.com/zan8in/afrog/blob/main/pocs/afrog-pocs/README.md))
* [x] Great performance, least requests, best results
* [x] Real-time display, scanning progress 
* [x] View `request` and `response` packets of scan results 
* [x] Start the program to automatically update the local PoC library  
* [x] Long-term maintenance, update PoC Ôºà[**afrog-pocs**](https://github.com/zan8in/afrog/tree/main/pocs/afrog-pocs) Ôºâ
* [x] API interface, easy access to other projects 
* [x] For secondary development, refer to `cmd/afrog/main.go` or join **[communication group](https://github.com/zan8in/afrog#%E4%BA%A4%E6%B5%81%E7% BE%A4)** Consulting
